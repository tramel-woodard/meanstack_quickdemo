# MEAN Stack - Quick Demo
I'm going to quickly code out this demo for Johnathan and friends to show my comprehension of a simple MEAN stack application, simple Angular methodology, Express framework style and general MongoDB connections and interaction.

This demo is under the assumption that you have a copy of MongoDB on your computer and are able to run both "mongod" and "mongo" commands on either your Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac).

### Installation
Clone the git repository to your local directory, change to the 'meanstack_quickdemo' directory and install all dependencies from the package.json file using the 'npm install' command:
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:tramel-woodard/meanstack_quickdemo.git
$ cd meanstack_quickdemo
$ npm install
```

### Running the Demo
Run the following command (in Terminal for Mac or Command Prompt for Windows) to launch the routing demo:
```sh
$ npm start
```
Finally, open your preferred browser and visit the following URL:
```sh
http://localhost:3000
```
