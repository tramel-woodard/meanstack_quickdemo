# MEAN Stack - Quick Demo
I'm going to quickly code out this demo for Johnathan and friends to show my comprehension of a simple MEAN stack application, simple Angular methodology, Express framework style and general MongoDB connections and interaction.

This demo is under the assumption that you have a copy of MongoDB on your computer and are able to run both "mongod" and "mongo" commands on either your Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac).

I will start by shrinkwrapping a few js libraries I know to not have any issues into my package.json file, and then later will create update to show the installation methods.
